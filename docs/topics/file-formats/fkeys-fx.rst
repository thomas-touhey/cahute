fx-9860G f-key files
====================

An fx-9860G f-key file is a data file containing images for function keys
(abbreviated f-keys) for internationalization, for fx-9860G and derivatives.
It can be identified using the ``G1N`` extension, and uses the
CASIO container with a subtype to be determined;
see :ref:`file-format-standardheader` for more information.

.. note::

    The calculator skips directly passed the header and only checks the
    extension of the file, and no example of a legitimate G1N file has been
    found yet.
