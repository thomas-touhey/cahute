``xfer9860`` command line reference
===================================

`xfer9860 <xfer9860 project page_>`_ is a tool originally released back in
June 2007 by Andreas Bertheussen for their fx-9860G SD. It is used to interact
with the calculator's storage memory from any calculator supporting
Protocol 7.00.

.. warning::

    This interface is provided by compatibility with Andres Bertheussen's
    work, and must not be changed to bring new features or change the syntax of
    existing ones.

The utility operates differently depending on the provided option:

``xfer9860 -u <local file path> <file name>``
    **U**\ pload the file as ``<file name>`` on the calculator's main
    storage device.

``xfer9860 -d <file name> <local file path>``
    **D**\ ownload the file named ``<file name>`` on the calculator's main
    storage device.

``xfer9860 -i``
    Gather **i**\ nformation regarding the calculator.

``xfer9860 -o``
    **O**\ ptimize the calculator's main storage device.

Available options for all operations are the following:

``-h``, ``-a``
    Display the help message and exit.

    ``-a`` actually stands for "**a**\ bout", and only displayed licensing
    information while ``-h`` stands for "**h**\ elp" and only displayed
    usage help.

    Cahute's implementation shows the same message for both options.

``-t``
    **T**\ hrottle in seconds, i.e. delay in milliseconds between packets.
